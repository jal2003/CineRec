## **Why I Built CineRec**

I created CineRec because, like many others, I often found myself endlessly browsing through countless movies instead of actually enjoying one. I thought, *“Wouldn’t it be great if there was a tool that could instantly recommend movies based on my taste?”* That’s when I decided to develop CineRec—a tool that combines my love for movies and AI while allowing me to build and deploy a full stack machine learning app.

## **How It Works**

CineRec uses a machine learning recommendation engine built with Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Here’s a breakdown of how the system works:

1. **Data Processing**: User preferences and viewing history are analyzed using Pandas and Numpy.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Scikit-Learn is used to implement collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms for movie recommendations.
3. **Frontend**: A clean, responsive UI built using ReactJS, allowing users to browse and receive recommendations effortlessly.
4. **Backend**: Flask handles API requests, processes data, and communicates with the frontend.
5. **Ratings & Likes**: CineRec not only recommends movies but also displays user ratings and likes to help make better choices.
